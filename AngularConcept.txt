To make angular app, First need to install angular cli using command "npm install -g @angular/cli", don't need to do when already installed
to check cli version use command "ng --version"
to create app, use "ng new app_name"

File and folder in angular
/src
	/app - it's a component
	/assests - include extra images and css
	/environments - server build related configuration
	index.html - first loaded file in whole project
	main.ts
	style.css - you can write global css
For advanced use:
	package-lock.json - it has the details information about all packages which are in package.json
	angular.json - Application configuration file
	tsconfig files (tsconfig.json) - Typescript configuration file
	.browserlistrc - Details about browser support
	karma.config.js
	polyfills.ts

There are three types of server - 1) Dev(Development) server. 2) Testing server. 3) Production server (live for world)

Databinding = communication btw .ts(component) and .html(view)

Typescript code -------------> Output data ->---------------------> Template (HTML)
									|
						1) String interpolation -> {{Property_data}}
									|
						2) Property binding -> [attributes_of_html] = "property_from_ts"
									|
Typescript code <-------------<- User event <----------------------- Template (HTML)
									|
						Event binding -> (event) = "expression"
						
						
						Combination of both: Two way binding --> [ngModal] = "Property_data"

Property means varibale inside a component class

Directives -> it is the instructions in DOM

--> ngModal - used for two way binding
--> *ngIf
--> ng-template
--> *ngFor 
--> ngClass

Event 
--> ngSubmit


lifecycle hook
1) ngOnChanges: Called after a bound input property changes
2) ngOnInit: Called once the component is initialized
3) ngDoCheck: Called during every change detection run
4) ngAfterContentInit: called after content(ng-content) has been projected into view
5) ngAfterContentChecked: Called every time the projected content has been checked
6) ngAfterViewInit: called after the component's view (and child views) has been initialized
7) ngAfterViewChecked: Called every time the view(and child views) have been checked
8) ngOnDestroy: Called once the component is about to be destroy

Serices in angular
Service is the classes that may have property(data) and function,
we can use these stuff in different files. Services are halper which helps us to share the data with multiple
complonent.

To create service use "ng g service nameOfservice"

Property binding is used to change/update the property or attribute
String interpolation accepts only number and string values but property binding also accepts boolean value with these.

componentName.component.ts - componentName.component.html --> "ng g c component_name" or "ng g c component_name"
serviceName.service.ts  --> 'ng g service name'
moduleName.module.ts --> 'ng g m name --routing'
pipeName.pipe.ts --> 'ng g p pipe_name'
directiveName.directive.ts --> 'ng g d directive_name'

Module in angular, it is not reusable -> Module <----- component
Module is the complete feature itself, for example user authentication is the whole module -> login, signup, forget password and confirm email are the components.
